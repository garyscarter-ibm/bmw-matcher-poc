/*
 * MINI Mingle — the matcher, played as a Valentine's swipe game.
 *
 * One of several interchangeable interface "modes" over the shared engine (see
 * ../modes/index.js and the shell in ../vehicle-matcher.js). Its premise, in one
 * line: swipes silently answer the same questionnaire the `questions` mode asks,
 * and the REAL engine does the matching. See docs/mini-mingle-requirements.md.
 *
 * The flow:
 *   1. A tiny "set your type" SEED step (budget + what's it for) — the two
 *      answers a swipe can't reliably read, and budget is the engine's one hard
 *      filter (so the deck is affordable from card one).
 *   2. A DECK of the retailer's real stock (POST /api/preview, scoped by the
 *      seed), shuffled, swiped one card at a time. Keeping/passing cards fills in
 *      the *taste* answer keys (body, fuel, style, priorities) — see
 *      swipesToAnswers().
 *   3. A RESULT: the assembled brief goes to the real /api/match (the identical
 *      call the questionnaire mode makes). The ENGINE'S pick wins; the swipe taste
 *      only re-ranks within the feasible set it returned. So the match is always
 *      a car the person could actually buy, with the engine's real reasons.
 *
 * This mode owns its own copy, cards and state — it deliberately does NOT reuse
 * the questionnaire mode's BRAND_COPY/matchCard (different voice, different card
 * shape). Only el/cardinal/gbp (ui.js) and the engine client are shared.
 *
 * The scoring engine and car dataset live behind an API (see server/ and
 * ../engine.js); this mode never sees the dataset — only the public display
 * fields the API returns.
