/*
 * Headless DOM harness for the client modes (render.test.js).
 *
 * The server-side tests (api/engine/brand) prove the engine and the HTTP
 * contract. This harness closes the last gap: it actually MOUNTS each interface
 * mode (questionnaire / swipe / knockout) in a real DOM and asserts it paints, per
 * brand — so a client render regression (a mode that throws on mount, or paints
 * nothing for a new brand) is caught by CI, not by eyeballing the browser.
 *
 * How it stays honest:
 *  - The modes talk to the engine over HTTP. We stand up a real buildServer()
 *    on an ephemeral port with an injected stock source (the same seam api.test
 *    uses), so a mode exercises the true endpoints and the true engine. Only the
 *    live feed is faked; everything downstream is production code.
 *  - The DOM is jsdom. We import the mode's ES module directly and call its
 *    mount(root, ctx) exactly as the shell does. `fetch` stays Node's real
 *    global (the modes call it against our server); jsdom supplies document /
 *    window / the handful of browser APIs the modes touch (matchMedia, share,
 *    clipboard), shimmed below so a mount can't crash on a missing global.
 *
 * A mode's mount() is fire-and-forget: it paints a skeleton now and swaps in
 * real content after an async boot(). settle() waits for that boot to land.
