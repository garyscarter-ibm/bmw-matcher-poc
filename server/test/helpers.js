/*
 * Test harness for the HTTP API layer (api.test.js).
 *
 * The engine's pure functions are covered by engine.test.js / brand.test.js.
 * This layer is about the *server*: routing, validation, response shape and
 * the size/enrich controls the game modes depend on. To test those without a
 * live feed we drive real HTTP against a `buildServer({...fakeStock})` instance
 * bound to port 0 (an ephemeral port — no collisions, no PORT), injecting an
 * in-memory stock source. Node 26's `mock.module` is unavailable and the
 * handlers bind the stock functions via a direct ESM import, so a real
 * injection seam (not monkeypatching) is the only way to keep tests hermetic.
 *
 * Fixtures are built the same way brand.test.js builds them: feed-shaped
 * objects run through the real `mapVehicle`, so the cars the fake feed serves
 * are engine-ready and indistinguishable from live stock — the tests exercise
 * the true code path, only the network is faked.

 *
 * The fakes mirror stock.js's real signatures — `fetchRetailerStock(brand,
