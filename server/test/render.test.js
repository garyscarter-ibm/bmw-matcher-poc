/*
 * Headless render tests — every interface mode, every brand, actually mounted.
 *
 * The api/engine/brand suites prove the server. These prove the CLIENT: that
 * each mode's mount(root, ctx) paints real content in a real DOM, for each
 * brand, driving the true engine over a real (in-process) server. This is the
 * machine check that stands in for eyeballing `?brand=<key>&mode=<key>` in a
 * browser after onboarding a brand — a mode that throws on mount, or renders
 * nothing for a new brand, fails here.
 *
 * See dom-harness.js for how the DOM + server are stood up. Only the live feed
 * is faked; the mode, the engine client, the endpoints and the engine are all
 * production code.
 *
 * Coverage note (testing gap this closes): before this file, no test mounted a
 * client mode at all — client render regressions were caught only by manual
 * browser checks. New brands are added to BRANDS below so their client render
 * is guarded from the day they land, not just their server-side mapping.
